## Installation

>You can download Python bindings for Selenium from the [PyPI page for selenium package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium). However, a better approach would be to use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/) to install the selenium package. Python 3.5 has pip available in the [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3.5/installing/index.html). Using *pip*, you can install selenium like this:
```
pip install selenium
```
At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)
